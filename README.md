## Data Scraping and MongoDB Data Storage

This script is designed to scrape data from a website that provides rental and residential property listings based on different locations available on the site. The script extracts information about rental properties and residential properties separately, based on their respective locations. It gathers data from the website's listings and organizes it into a structured format for further analysis and use.
This repository contains a Python script for data scraping from a specific website and saving the scraped data into a MongoDB database. The script leverages the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and pymongo library for interacting with the MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Python
2. BeautifulSoup library
3. pymongo library
4. MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or accessible server

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Update the `url` variable in the script to the website from which you want to scrape data.
2. Customize the web scraping logic in the script according to the website's structure and data requirements.
3. Run the script using `python data_scraping.py`. The script will scrape the data and save it into the MongoDB database.

## MongoDB Configuration

Make sure you have a MongoDB database set up and ready to use. Update the MongoDB connection details (hostname, port, authentication credentials, etc.) in the script's `mongodb_config` section.

## Data Structure

The scraped data will be stored in a specific collection within the MongoDB database. Define the data structure and document format to ensure proper storage and retrieval.

## Data Cleaning and Validation

Consider implementing data cleaning and validation steps before saving the data to ensure data integrity and consistency.
